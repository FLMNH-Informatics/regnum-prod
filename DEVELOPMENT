Instructions for running locally on *nix systems. 

- checkout `main` branch from regnum-prod repository
- install RVM https://rvm.io/rvm/install
- install Ruby 2.5.9 with RVM (`rvm install 2.5.9`) (hoping this step isn't too hard on whichever platform you are on, I ran into a few bumps with Ubuntu and OpenSSL but was able to resolve them) 
- run ruby gem system updae (`gem update --system 3.2.3`)
- install bundler gem  (`gem install bundler`)
- install regnum app gems with bundler (`bundler install`)
- install MySQL and required client packages, create user with admin access that batches database.yml configuration
- rake db:create  (it might say the DB already exists)
- rake db:schema:load
- rake db:seed 
- install DB seeds with rake `rake db:seed` (need this to install user roles and statuses)
- run the server with `rails server -u webrick`  (this runs a webrick server and it might first error out and ask you to create a config/secrets.yml file, just follow the instructions https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32397607/missing-secret-token-and-secret-key-base-for-development-environment-set)
